            </div>
            <div class="ing">
              <h3>Ingredients For Pulihora</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>1 cup Rice,1 tbsp Urad dal,1 tsp Cumin Seeds</li>
                <li>4 tbsp Split Channa Dal</li>
                <li>4 tbsp Tamarind Pulp,1 tbsp Split Channa Dal</li>
                <li>4 tbsp Oil,1 tsp Mustard Seeds,4 tbsp Raw Peanuts</li>
                <li>
                  6 Dry Red Chilli,1 sprig Curry leaves,1 tsp Turmeric powder
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Preparation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Wash rice and dal together and take them in a pressure cooker.
                  Pour 2 ½ to 3 cups of water and
                </li>
                <li>
                  pressure cook them for 3 whistle. Switch off the flame.Let the
                  pressure go all by itself, open the pressure cooker and fluff
                  it with a fork.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now lets makes the tamarind paste. Take tamarind pulp and add
                  half cup of water and bring it to a boil. Cook this till the
                  pulp gets cooked and thick and raw smell gets away. If you are
                  using whole tamarind fruit, first soak that in warm water for
                  15 mins, squeeze to get the pulp out, strain it and continue
                  with the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pour this tamarind pulp over the rice and mix well. Now make
                  the seasoning. Heat oil in a kadai. Add all the ingredients
                  given the seasoning list in the given order and fry them on
                  low heat for 2-3 mins till everything is toasted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pour this seasoning over the rice and mix well. Serve hot with
                  papad and pickle.
                </li>

              <p>Chicken Fry</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ing">
              <h3>Ingredients For Chicken fry :</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Chicken - I used boneless chicken thigh for making chicken
                  fry. Chicken thighs will result in more juicy chicken. But
                  chicken breast can be used as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fresh Produce - ginger, garlic, curry leaves are freshly
                  ground and added to chicken fry for flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spices- chilli, coriander, turmeric and garam masala powder
                  adds so much taste and flavor to the chicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lemon - I prefer to add extra lemon juice or vinegar to the
                  chicken to get rid of the chicken smell. it also adds a fresh
                  taste to the chicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Oil - any neutral oil is used. But personally for frying
                  chicken or fish, I like to use coconut oil. It adds so much
                  flavor.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Preparation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Take garlic, ginger and curry leaves in a blender</li>
                <li>Grind to a coarse puree without adding water</li>
                <li>
                  Take chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, pepper
                  powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder and salt in a
                  bowl
                </li>
                <li>Add the ground garlic and curry leaves puree</li>
                <li>Add lemon juice or vinegar</li>
                <li>
                  Add all purpose flour / maida, Add in rice flour,Mix well,Add
                  in water,Make it into a thick paste
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add in chicken cubes. this is boneless chicken thighs,Mix
                  well,Deep fry in hot oil,Cook till golden brown.

              <p>Fish Curry</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ing">
              <h3>Ingredients For Fish curry</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The masala base is made with onions, tomatoes, fennel seeds,
                  spice powder and coconut. These ingredients are stir fried in
                  oil and ground into a paste. This adds thickness to the gravy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  like all curries, this fish curry has onion tomato as base. I
                  like to slice my onions for faster cooking. These provide a
                  thickness to the curry and adds a sweet taste.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I use kashmiri chilli powder, coriander powder and turmeric in
                  this. Instead of powder spices you can use them in whole. In
                  that case, you can add 5 to 6 dry red chillies and 3 tbsp
                  coriander seeds.
                </li>
                <li>adds a refreshing minty aroma to the dish.</li>
                <li>
                  I used ginger garlic paste, you can add 1 inch piece of
                  chopped ginger and 6 whole garlic cloves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  for fish curry you can use any variety of fish. Usually fish
                  with bones still intact adds flavour to the curry. But if you
                  prefer boneless you can use them too.
                </li>
                <li>
                  dried tamarind is soaked in water, squeezed to extract the
                  pulp and used in the curry. Tamarind adds sourness so you can
                  add as much as you prefer.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Preparation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Heat coconut oil in a claypot. Add in fennel seeds and saute
                  it for a min. It should sizzle and flavour the entire oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add in ginger garlic paste and saute till raw smell leaves
                  from it. Instead of ginger and garlic paste you can use
                  chopped ginger and peeled whole garlic cloves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add in spice powders and saute for a minute. Instead of using
                  spice powder, you can add whole spices like dry red chillies
                  and coriander seeds
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now let's make the fish curry. In the same kadai, add in
                  coconut oil and let it heat Add in mustard seeds and crackle
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pour in the ground coconut masala and mix well. Stir fry in
                  the oil for 5 to 6 minutes and Cook till oil separates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pour in tamarind extract. For making the extract, take small
                  lime size tamarind in a bowl, cover it with water and let it
                  soak for 10 minutes. Squeeze the tamarind with your hands and
                  extract the pulp.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Add enough salt and mix the fish slices,Cook this on low
                  medium heat for 10 minutes.

                  First, soak 12 to 15 cashews in hot water for 20 to 30
                  minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the cashews are soaking, roughly chop 2 large tomatoes, 1
                  large onion, 1 inch ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium garlic
                  cloves. Crush the ginger and garlic to a paste in
                  mortar-pestle.
                </li>
                <li>Add the chopped onions to a blender or grinder jar.</li>
                <li>
                  Without adding any water, grind or blend to a smooth and fine
                  paste. Remove to a bowl and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To the same grinder jar (no need to wash it), add chopped
                  tomatoes and soaked cashews.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Again without adding any water, grind or blend tomatoes and
                  cashews to a fine smooth paste. Keep the jar aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a thick bottomed pan or kadai. Add
                  the onion paste.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sauté the onion paste over a low to medium-low heat, stirring
                  often. Be careful while adding onion paste as it splutters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sauté till the onion paste begins to caramelize and become
                  golden.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the crushed ginger-garlic paste. If using ready
                  ginger-garlic paste, then add 1 teaspoon of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stir and sauté for few seconds or till the raw aroma of
                  ginger-garlic goes away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now add the tomato-cashew paste. Be careful as the mixture can
                  splutter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mix in the cream until well incorporated. Switch off the heat.
                  Taste the cottage cheese curry, adding more salt if required.
                  You can also add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar at this step if it
                  tastes too tangy from the tomatoes, being sure to mix it in
                  very well.

                  <b>Step 1</b> Boil and soak the rice Wash and drain the
                  basmati rice and soak for about 20 minutes. Take a deep pan,
                  put it on medium flame and pour water into it. Bring it to a
                  boil, and then add the soaked rice. Cover the pan with a lid
                  and cook on medium flame till the rice becomes soft, but not
                  mushy. Now remove from fire and keep it aside for later usage.

                  Now put the chopped tomatoes in a blender and blend them
                  properly. Transfer the puree to a bowl and keep it aside. Now

                <li>
                  <b>Step 4</b> Tips for making delicious Tomato Rice 1. This
                  dish is generally spicy in flavour, so to make it less spicy,
                  add less ginger and chillies. 2. Tomato rice tastes best when
                  served with a well seasoned Boondi Raita. 3. Stirring the rice
                  in the tomato mix before adding the water enhances the taste
                  of the dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Tips :</b>You can dry roast the whole spices, grind them
                  and add the powder to enhance the taste of this dish. You can
                  also use coconut oil to prepare tomato rice. Consider making
                  tomato puree at home with fresh tomatoes for best taste.
